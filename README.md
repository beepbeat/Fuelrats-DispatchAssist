Greetings Commander. Dispatch.py is a module that aims to ease the burden on Fuel Rat dispatchers by offering a dispatch board and the means of keeping it up to date.

# Requirements:
* Hexchat - {link} - currently this project only supports Hexchat. 
* Python 3.5.2 - {link}
* Tabulate - {link} This is for graphical representation of the collected data

Plans are in place to support other IRC clients that have a python3 interface at later point in time
# Usage:
Once loaded into hexchat, it will automaticially detect Ratsignals as they arrive in #Fuelrats
You can view the collected data with the command `/board`
## Case management:
### 1. Move case ID
If a entry was created with an incorrect index, you can move it via `/mv` followed by the current index and the new index as follows:
`/mv {current_index} {new_index}`

Example:
`/mv -1 2`  

This will move the case at index -1 to case #2. 
**BEWARE: this will overwrite the destination case!**

### 2. Delete case
If a case should have beem cleared but was not, you can delete the case using the `/rm {case_ID}` command or its alias `/del {case_ID}`

Example:
`/del 2` 

This will delete case #2 from the board and stop tracking it.
